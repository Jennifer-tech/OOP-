# OOP-

Object- Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.

This file shows the division of the kingdom Animal into different division using Classes. Different paradigms of classes such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism were used to prevent repetition of code and ensure a well-structured code.

# Encapsulation 
It was used to group related variables and functions that operates on them are grouped into object.

# Abstraction
It hides the complex nature of operation from outside making the interface simpler and reducing the impact of change.

# Inheritance 
It was used to eliminate redundant code.

# Polymorphism
It was used to get rid of long if/else or switch & case statements.

# How to use

* "cd into the file directory"
* Run "node <filename>"
* console messages of the classes and their properties would be displayed

# Features
